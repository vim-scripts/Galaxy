        <leader>glg or :GalaxyGen
        Input your scheme's name.
        Then choose a color as the schemes background. then press 'q'
        To quit the choosing window. The schemes auto generated.
        And you will got your scheme loaded immediately.

    Edit your schemes~
        Move cursor on the color you want to edit. 
        Then press 'e'
        Then choose your desired color for it.
        Press 'q' to quit the window. 
        And you will got the changed scheme loaded immediately.

    Generate schemes with colorlist~
        Open ColorV built-in colorname list.
        <leader>cl or :ColorVlist
        You will see a colorlist window opened with W3C standard colorname.
        Put cursor in it. Then press '<leader>gla' 
        All the colorlist in it will be generated to schemes.
        Now you got 100+ schemes.
        color-list like 'COLORNAME #ffffff' will be processed.

        If it does not work correctly.
        You should check your '&t_Co' option.
        And set 'g:galaxy_term_color' to the number it support.

    NOTE    Your previous_scheme is cached on your disk.
            And gui scheme is seperated with terminal.
            So you can set them with different scheme.

    NOTE    Terminal scheme in 8/16 terminal color is predefined.
            And the 'cursorline' option is on by default.

    NOTE    Terminal cursor may have bugs.
