    *Galaxy* is a colorscheme tries to make colorscheming simpler.
    
    A nice colorscheme is good for our eyes (and display).
    But generating one is not that easy.
    When generating a colorschemes, you must dealing with lots of issues: 
    colors, highlight groups, syntaxs, terminals...

    |Galaxy| tries to simplifiy these works. 
    
    It classifies highlights in 'bgd','fgd','syn','msg','dif' group,
    and automatically generate these highlight colors with these 5 group's 
    basic colors. And do other stuffs to finish highlighting.

    So, for one scheme, only 5 colors are needed.

    It contains several built-in schemes.
    Also Scheme Window, Screen Window, Terminal Support, Stylish Statusline,
    Indent Highlight and more...
